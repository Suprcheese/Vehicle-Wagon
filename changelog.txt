    - Trains now remember their mode (auto/manual) after winching vehicles on/off them. (legendblade)

    - Lengthened the winching-sound, and added a second variant. Vehicles also (un)load a bit more slowly.
    - The "Vehicle selected..." tutorial message will now only appear the first few times you click a vehicle with a Winch. Once you've got the hang of things, no point in repeating it.
    - Changed the Winch to be a capsule-type item. This adds a range visualization circle, among other things, but core functionality is of course unchanged.
